The purpose of this project came about when browsing for vehicles online. 
I was interested in seeing how two vehicles compared in the long-term, while paying off the car loan, in comparison 
to gas consumption.

For example:

Lexus IS 300 - $400/month - 26/19 h/c mpg

vs

BMW 330i - $500/month - 33/24 h/c mpg

Given a 100 mile per day commute
$2.88 per gallon of gas

Which would end up being the more economic buy on just these two variables?
